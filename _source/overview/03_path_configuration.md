# Path Configuration

Hotwire Native apps can be configured via a JSON file called the *path configuration*. The *path configuration* is broken down into two top-level objects: `settings` and `rules`. An empty path configuration requires both keys, as follows:

```json
{
  "settings": {},
  "rules": []
}
```

`settings` contains App-level configuration. These settings can be read when the *path configuration* is first loaded; common use cases include feature-flags, ActionCable configuration, or custom app information.

`rules` contains entries that define navigation within the Hotwire app. Each entry contains regex used to identify URLs and then apply the outlined behavior on navigation. In the follwoing example, all URLs that match regex `/new$` will open up in a modal screen instead of being pushed into the navigation stack.

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "feature_flags": [
        {
          "name": "new_onboarding_flow",
          "enabled": true
        }
      ]
  },
  "rules": [
    {
      "patterns": [
        "/new$"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "context": "modal"
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

It's recommended that the *path configuration* file exists both locally (bundled with your app's binary) and remotely (on your server). The local *path configuration* ensures a smooth initial launch, while the remote *path configuration* unlocks a powerful perk: you can change the app's behavior without needing to publish a new app update.

## Versioning

It is recommended to version your path configuration file names and use a unique resource per platform, like so:

* `/configurations/ios_v1.json`
* `/configurations/android_v1.json`

This allows forward and backward compatibility with new app versions that you release. If you make breaking changes in a new version of your app then start pointing to `*_v2.json` for the new build. Keep old versions available so older clients can continue to work properly until the app is updated.

See the [iOS](/ios/path-configuration)- and [Android](/android/path-configuration)-specific pages on path configuration for more details and examples.

The [path configuration reference](/reference/path-configuration) provides more information including all the behavior Hotwire Native provides out of the box.
