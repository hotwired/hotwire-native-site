    Building completely native mobile apps is often time-consuming, requires large teams, and every update needs to wind its way through the app store review process. <b>Hotwire Native</b> provides an answer to all of these drawbacks with its web-first approach.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Hotwire Native enables you to build your screens once, in HTML and CSS, and reuse them across all your mobile platforms. If you already have a <a href="https://hotwired.dev">Hotwire</a> web app, you can use the screens you've already built!
  </p>

  <p>
    It unlocks bug fixes and new features without having to go through app store review. And full access to underlying Android and iOS SDKs and APIs as soon as they are released.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hotwire Native means small teams can build highly functional, beautiful, and sustainable mobile apps. All without the headache and rigmarole of traditional native development.
  </p>

  <p>
    The framework wraps a web view within a native shell and renders HTML from your server. Native navigation and transition animations between screens work automatically out-of-the-box. And for those instances when the web's not enough, you can upgrade to fully native screens and components.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's all done by combining the power of <a href="https://turbo.hotwired.dev">Turbo</a> and <a href="https://strada.hotwired.dev">Strada</a> together into a single top-level framework that makes it easy to build your own mobile apps.
