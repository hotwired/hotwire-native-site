    Building fully native mobile apps can be a real pain. It often looks like this:
    <ul>
      <li>The development process is <b>very slow</b></li>
      <li><b>Large teams</b> of specialized developers are required</li>
      <li>Each feature must be <b>re-implemented</b> across every platform</li>
      <li>Every update needs to wind its way through the app store <b>review process</b></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Hotwire Native</b> provides an answer to all of these drawbacks with its web-first approach.</b> The framework enables you to build your screens once, in HTML and CSS, and reuse them across every platform. If you already have a <a href="https://hotwired.dev">Hotwire</a> web app, you can use the screens you've already built!
  </p>

  <p>
    It unlocks bug fixes and new features without having to go through app store review. And you have full access to underlying iOS and Android SDKs and APIs as soon as they are released.
  </p>

  <p>
    Small teams can build highly functional, beautiful, and sustainable mobile apps. All without the headache and rigmarole of traditional native development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hotwire Native is a high-level native framework, available for iOS and Android, that provides you with all the tools you need to leverage your web app and build great mobile apps. It wraps a web view within a native shell and renders HTML from your server. Native navigation and transition animations between screens work automatically out-of-the-box.
